Hello, I'm a graduate student at Clemson University in the DSA program. 


I work full time as a financial analyst for a checmical company. 


In my free time I like spending time outside with my wife and two boys playing games, going on hikes and haning out in our backyard. 
I also enjoy reading both books and comicbooks, watching movies and listening to music. 

I am hoping to learn more about using Github online and get better at coding.
